# Current Crawl Policy

This document describes the network-free URL and scope foundation. A successful scope decision
is **not** authorization to perform a network request.

## URL normalization contract

`normalize_url` accepts absolute HTTP and HTTPS URLs. Relative references are accepted only
when the caller supplies an already validated `NormalizedUrl` base. Missing schemes are never
guessed, and protocol-relative references require an explicit base.

The returned value retains the original submitted string and exposes the normalized absolute
URL, scheme, normalized hostname, effective port, and origin. `NormalizedUrl` instances cannot
be constructed through their public constructor; they come from the validation boundary.

Normalization:

- accepts only `http` and `https`;
- rejects missing hosts, URL credentials, malformed ports, invalid hostname labels, whitespace,
  control characters, and invalid percent escapes;
- lowercases schemes and hostnames;
- converts Unicode hostnames to lowercase ASCII IDNA form;
- removes fragments;
- removes explicit port 80 from HTTP and port 443 from HTTPS;
- preserves other valid ports and reports effective ports for all URLs;
- changes an empty path to `/`;
- removes literal `.` and `..` path segments;
- preserves path case, repeated slashes, and trailing-slash distinctions;
- preserves query order, repeated keys, blank values, name/value casing, and all parameters;
- preserves percent-encoded reserved characters and uppercases escape hex digits without
  decoding them into delimiters; and
- is idempotent.

It does not perform canonicalization, strip UTM/session values, sort queries, merge `www` with
an apex host, merge slash variants, resolve DNS, or make an HTTP request.

## Scope policies

Every policy has a validated seed URL, host-matching mode, and allowed scheme/effective-port
pairs. The seed's scheme and effective port are always included.

### Exact host

This is the default. Only the seed hostname is allowed. `example.com` and `www.example.com` are
distinct. Hostname comparison occurs after lowercase and IDNA normalization.

### Include subdomains

The seed hostname and true descendants ending with `.` plus the seed hostname are allowed.
`blog.example.com` is a descendant of `example.com`; `badexample.com` and
`example.com.evil.test` are not. A seed of `shop.example.com` can include
`news.shop.example.com`, but it does not broaden to `example.com` or `blog.example.com`.

### Explicit approved hosts

The seed host and a normalized explicit set of additional hosts are allowed. Approved hosts use
the same hostname validation as URLs. Approval of `blog.example.com` does not imply approval of
`news.blog.example.com`.

## Port and scheme sensitivity

HTTP without an explicit port has effective port 80; HTTPS has effective port 443. Explicit
default ports normalize to the same origins. Other ports are denied unless their exact
scheme/effective-port pair is configured. HTTP and HTTPS remain distinct.

This is a crawl-scope decision only. It is not the future network port-safety policy.

## Stable reason codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `allowed_exact_host` | Host exactly matches the seed host. |
| `allowed_subdomain` | Host is a true descendant under subdomain mode. |
| `allowed_approved_host` | Host appears in the explicit approved set. |
| `denied_host_mismatch` | Host is outside the selected host policy. |
| `denied_false_suffix_match` | Text suffix resembles the seed but lacks a label boundary. |
| `denied_port_mismatch` | Effective port is not allowed for the destination scheme. |
| `denied_scheme` | Scheme is unsupported or absent from allowed origins. |
| `denied_invalid_url` | Destination failed URL validation for another reason. |

Each decision also includes a human-readable explanation, evaluated hostname and effective
port when available, and the relevant configured host and origin.

## Current limitations and deferred controls

The current code evaluates strings only. The following remain deferred:

- SSRF protections and unsafe-address classification
- DNS and connected-address validation
- redirect-target validation at every hop
- HTTP fetching, timeouts, response limits, and content handling
- `robots.txt`, meta robots, and X-Robots-Tag handling
- enforced rate limiting and bounded concurrency
- HTML and metadata extraction
- canonical, duplicate, indexability, and sitemap decisions
- background jobs, persistence, progress, cancellation, XML, and CSV

No caller should treat `decision.allowed` as sufficient permission to connect. Future network
authorization must combine scope evidence with DNS, address, port, redirect, robots, resource,
and operational safety controls.
